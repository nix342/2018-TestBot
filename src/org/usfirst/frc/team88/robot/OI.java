		// three ways:

		// button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
		//    Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
		//    until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.

		// button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
		//    Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
		//    the button is released.

		// button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
		//    Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
		//    until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
